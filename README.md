# Data Cleaning Challenge

If you are into the __data__ world you've probably heard of the __#dataCleaningChallenge__ organized by [@PromiseNonso_](https://twitter.com/PromiseNonso_) and [@vicSomadina](https://twitter.com/vicSomadina) via __twitter__.

## Data cleaning

Data cleaning is a crucial aspect among the steps involved in analyzing data, in order to make sure the data is accurate, thorough, and dependable, it requires locating and fixing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies. Remember _garbage in garbage out_.

## Original dataset

The _original dataset_ is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yagunnersya/fifa-21-messy-raw-dataset-for-cleaning-exploring) but as you know, datasets on Kaggle are not messy or dirty like real world datasets.

Datasets provided by stakeholders come out of order, some fields have line breaks, they don't have the correct information, and we need to get it from other fields, etc.

## Practice

If you want to become a _data analyst_ __practice__ is the best way to achieve your goals. With this repository I want you to practice beyond the easy part. What if you don't have the ages in the csv you are working on and you need to get it from another csv? What if you don't have the full name but you need that information?

__PRACTICE__ is the key. So let's practice.

I already gave you some key points of what you should do with the data provided in this _repository_, but there is much more to do.

Share your solutions with me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/axel_bol) or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/axel-alvarado/) and this way I can learn from you too.

Next week I'll be sharing my own solution.

ðŸŽ‰ __HAPPY CODING!__
